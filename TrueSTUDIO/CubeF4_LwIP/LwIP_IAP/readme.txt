@par Application Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run In-Application Programming 
(IAP) over Ethernet. 

Two IAP options are provided: 
 - IAP using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
 - IAP using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 

User has select through compile options (in main.h file) to include one or both 
options.

User has to reset the device while Pushing KEY button to enter IAP mode.

If the LCD is used (#define USE_LCD in main.h), log messages will be displayed 
to inform user about ethernet cable status and the IP address value, else this 
will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED2: ethernet cable is not connected.

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define USE_DHCP in main.h) 

1- LwIP/LwIP_IAP/Binary directory contains the following binaries: 

- STM324xG_EVAL_Demonstration_Builder.bin: provides an overview of different modules in the demonstration: 

* Connection modes ( ethernet, USB,Serial)

* Multimedia (Audio,Image viewer,Camera,Recorder)

* Utilities: system, calendar,file browser, ...)

- STM324xG_EVAL_HTTP_Server: run a http server application whuich can be excuted to:

* provide informations about STM32F4 and LwIP stack.

* allow to control the four LEDs located in the STM324xG_EVAL board

* show the ADC3 channel 7 analog input converted value
 

- STM324xG_EVAL_SysTick.bin: can be used to be transfered and executed. It toggles the 4 LEDs.

2-  The required userID and password are set, and can be modified, in the main.h file.

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the HAL time base to configure 
the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be set lower (numerically greater) 
than the HAL tick interrupt priority to ensure that the System tick increments while executing 
the Ethernet Link ISR.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
   
  - This application runs on STM32F407xx/STM32F417xx Devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM324xG-EVAL board
     - Http clients: Firefox Mozilla V24 or Microsoft Internet Explorer V8.
     - TFTP client and DHCP server: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/)
      
  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
